---

This repository contains a suite of tools for converting 3D Gaussian Splatting files between various formats. The core logic is written in **Rust** for maximum performance and safety, and is deployed across multiple targets, including a native CLI and a WebAssembly-powered web app.

## üì¶ Repository Structure

This is a monorepo containing several related packages. Here's what you'll find in each directory:

| Package | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| **[`./converter_core`](./converter_core)** | The heart of the toolkit. A Rust library that provides the core logic for all import and export operations. If you want to understand the conversion architecture, start here. |
| **[`./gs-flux`](./gs-flux)** | A simple command-line interface (CLI) built on top of `converter-core`.|
| **[`./gs-flux-desktop`](./gs-flux-desktop)** | A desktop application built on top of `converter-core`. Built with Tauri. |
| **[`./wasm`](./wasm)** | A WebAssembly build of `converter-core`, complete with a simple frontend. This demonstrates how to run the converter entirely in the browser. |

## üöÄ Quick Start

Depending on your needs, you can use the tools in a few different ways.

### Using the CLI (`gs-flux`)

For local file conversion, the CLI is the best tool for the job.

```bash
# Example: Convert a .ply file to the compressed .spz format
gs-flux input.ply output.spz
```

For full installation and usage instructions, see the **[gs-flux README](./gs-flux/README.md)**.

### Using the Web App (WASM)

To run the converter directly in your browser, you can build and serve the WebAssembly package.

For detailed instructions, see the **[wasm README](./wasm/README.md)**.

### Using the Desktop app

For detailed instructions, see the **[gs-flux-desktop README](./gs-flux-desktop/README.md)**.
